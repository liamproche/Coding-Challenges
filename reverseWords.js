// Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

// A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

// Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

// Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.


const reverseWords = (s) => {
    const firstArr = []
    const secodArr = s.split(' ')
};

//define an empty arr

//split words into another arr at the space

//loop through the second arr pushing only the words (not the spaces) into the first array

//reverse the first arr

//return arr.join(' ')
